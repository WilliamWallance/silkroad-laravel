### Downloading

1. First you need to clone the repo on your computer.
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Devsome/silkroad-laravel.git
    ```
2. If you want to use vagrant.
    ```
    vagarnt up
    ``` 
3. Go with `vagrant ssh` into your VM and run the following commands from the `/var/www`
    1. Composer
        ```
        composer install
        ```
    2. Editing the `_AddLogChar` mssql Procedure. After all the `set` variables you need to paste this stuff.
        ```sql
        BEGIN
            SET NOCOUNT ON;
               INSERT INTO loginhistory ([CharID], [status])
               VALUES (@CharID, @EventId)

               IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM onlineofflinelog WHERE CharID = @CharID)
                    UPDATE onlineofflinelog
                    SET    status = @EventID
                    WHERE  CharID = @CharID
               ELSE
                   INSERT INTO onlineofflinelog ([CharID],  [status])
                   VALUES  (@CharID, @EventID)
        END
        ```
        That inserts a record into the `SRO_VT_LOG.onlineofflinelog` & `SRO_VT_LOG.loginhistory`. If you think, that you are missing that table. Do the next step and the Table exist.
    3. Laravel stuff
        ```bash
        php artisan storage:link && php artisan key:generate && php artisan migrate --seed
        ```
4. (Optional) You can generate a ssh key for your local maschine. Just read the [ssl-script README.md](/ssl-script/README.md)
5. Add to your hosts file the following:
    ```
    50.51.52.53 silkroad-laravel
    ```
6. If you want to connect to the local mysql Database
    1. SSH Host: `50.51.52.53`
    2. Username: `vagrant`
    3. Password: `vagrant`
    4. MySQL Host: `127.0.0.1`
    5: Username: `root`
    6. Password: `root`
    
    Also in the Vagrantfile.

7. Edit the `.env.example` to `.env` and change your credentials.

8. Setting up your Cronjobs
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
    Then paste this and put it on the last line.
    ```bash
    * * * * * php /var/www/artisan schedule:run
    ```
